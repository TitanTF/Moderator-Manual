# Overview

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Features described in this manual are intended \(and will only work\) **for moderators only**.

Other users can refer to this manual as a guideline on how moderators handle punishments, as well as identifying moderators that are abusing their power.
{% endhint %}

You are to use the powers given to you with great responsibility and consideration when moderating our services.

{% hint style="danger" %}
 **We take abuse seriously,** but we do not want to be very nit-picky about everything you do either. When taking any actions, you should be prepared to take responsibility for it.
{% endhint %}
