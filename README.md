# The Directory

Moderators are to use their powers with great responsibility and consideration when moderating our services.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The information described in this directory is intended **for moderators only**. For non-moderators, you can refer to this directory as a reference to how our moderators handle punishments and you will be able to identify moderators that are abusing their power. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
 **We take power abuse seriously,** but we do not want to be very nit-picky about everything moderators do either. When taking any actions, be prepared to take responsibility for it.  
  
Always follow this manual for information on handling situations. Contact the owner if you have doubts.
