#### How do I use a command on a player with an untypable name?

> 1. Type `status` in your console.
> 2. Find the ID \(numbers\) of the player's name which is located on the left.
> 3. Type the command you want to execute by replacing the &lt;target&gt; with  \#&lt;player's ID&gt; \( eg: !kick \#23 "Spamming" \)

{% hint style="info" %}
Some command doesn't support this method. \(!bring , !goto, etc\)
{% endhint %}
