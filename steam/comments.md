# Comments

Steam group comments that break [global rules](https://titan.tf/rules) are to be removed, with a warning given to the user in the comments section in the following format.

> @playername A comment you posted here has been removed due to violation of global rules. Please follow the global rules \(https://titan.tf/rules\) to avoid a kick from the group the next time.

## Spam

Anyone sending a long consecutive chain of messages \(_that seems to be done on purpose_, also known as **a nuisance**\) in a short amount of time, are to be kicked from the Steam group immediately.
